Problem 1
(a)
The analytic expression of the expected value of the size of population at
generation t, i.e., E(N(t)) = u^t.
u = E(X) = 0*0.5 + 0.5*2 = 1
So E(N(t)) = 1 for all t.
This result matches with the simulated results.

(b)
The probability of extinction of the 1000 population is 0.998.
For t = infinity, the probability of extinction of the 1000 population is 1 from simulation.

(c)
The probability of extinction q_t+1 = G(q_t) with q_0 = 0
and G(z) = E(z^X).
We can compute the q_t using the above recursive equation.
Then p(N(t)>0) = 1 - p(N(t) = 0).

(d)
The probability of extinction from simulation for the 15th generation is 0.8975.
The probability from analytic expression is 0.8986.
They are very close.

Problem 2.
(a) u = E(X) = 21/41*2 = 42/41
E(N(14)) = u^14 = 1.4013
The simulated result is 1.4048. So the analytic result matches with simulation.

(b)-(d)
The probability of extinction from simulation for the 15th generation is 0.8642.
The probability from analytic expression is 0.8754.
They are very close.

Solve q = G(q) for q. q = E(q^X) = 1*20/41 + 21/41*q^2. We obtain q = 20/21
E(N(t)|N(t)>0) \approx u^t/(1-q) = 21*(42/41)^t
When t goes to infinity, E(N(t)|N(t)>0) also goes to infinity.
This result matches with the simulation result.
